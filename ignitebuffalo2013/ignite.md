Lessons Learned Running a User Group
===

1. **Start it**
    * Even if there are only two people, get a table at Spot, buy your new friend a coffee and talk shop
    * Startup costs
      * Meetup costs $72 to create a group for 6 months, $45 for 3 months. This is a shitty unavoidable cost (for reasons I'll get into in a moment)

2. **Meetup (sigh)**
    * I don't particularly like Meetup but tons of people use the site to find nearby events. So signup for an account. It's not free but you're already investing your time, I think the basic account is $12/month

3. **Beer is king, seriously**
    * Attendance tends to skyrocket if you have free beer. This may seem trivial but it's kind of a strong point. Not just beer, if your event is at night it's likely that attendants are coming directly from work. Feed them, have drinks. It costs, what, $20/month?

4. **Be open to non-content**
    * Don't be aggressive towards recruiters, instead treat them like someone that wants to learn what you're teaching. Best case is you get someone new interested, worst case your other attendees get a job offer.

5. **Have content for the people that care**
    * Until you can get enough attendees to generate content for you, generate content yourself. Good content. You're starting this group so chances are you know _something_ about the group topic. If not, if you're a complete newbie and you just want to attract other people that know what they're doing then have a "Learning together" type session where you find a reputable tutorial and go through parts of it as a group. This is an amazing learning experience for all people involved. The more advanced people can help out.

6. (Tech user group specific) **Maintain separately paced content tracks**
    * Newbie content at the opening at the meetup, advanced content at the end
